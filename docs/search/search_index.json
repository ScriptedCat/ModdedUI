You should use this for anything \"Aiming\" based. Examples include silent aim and aimbot. Why should I use this? Built in, there is \"patches\" for many games. This means it is very easy to make aiming scripts for many games. In addition, there is already pre-made features (e.g. FOV / Hit Chance) which allows you to create high-quality aiming scripts while minimising bugs and time taken. Can I contribute? Of course, you can create pull requests for things such as Game Patches and additional features! Can I use this? You are allowed to use this, but you must credit me - asper the license agreement. Usage Simply load the script like this: -- // Dependencies local Aiming = loadstring ( game : HttpGet ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stefanuk12/Aiming/main/Load.lua\" ))()( \"Module\" ) Warning Please use the loader, instead of directly using the module. In rare cases, load the game patch for the specific game - if you have to. This is because you miss out on the automatic patch apply! Loading Specific Game Patches Some games like Rush Point may have multiple place ids. In order to load the correct patch, you can set the second argument as the name of the patch you want. For example: -- // Dependencies local Aiming = loadstring ( game : HttpGet ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stefanuk12/Aiming/main/Load.lua\" ))()( \"Module\" , \"RushPoint\" ) What does the first argument mean? The first argument is the type of module you want. There are two types - NPC and Module . NPC is specifically designed to work with NPCs (but it requires configuration) and Module is specifically for Players. Loading the GUI To load the GUI, simply execute: loadstring ( game : HttpGet ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stefanuk12/Aiming/main/GUI.lua\" ))() It returns the UI and the Aiming Page so you can append to it as you wish. It uses my fork of the Venyx UI Library. Note Make sure to execute the GUI before the Aim Lock , if you wish to have the GUI for the Aim Lock too.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"#what-can-i-use-this-for","text":"You should use this for anything \"Aiming\" based.
